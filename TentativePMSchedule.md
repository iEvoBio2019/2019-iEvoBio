# Tentative PM Schedule

Afternoon session - "Career development for computational biologists: Identifying challenges in delivering computational education"

1:15-2:45: Plenary talks - 12 minutes + questions. Contributed talks from the community.

1. What are you teaching in computational biology? 
2. Who is your audience?
3. How do you deliver content? (i.e., virtual boxes, JupyterHub, Raspberry Pi)
4. What is going well?
5. What is going poorly?
6. What would you like to have feedback on? 


3:00 - 4:15: Birds of a feather. Split up into groups and identify what is going well in terms of computational biology education. Who would you recommend your syllabus to? Who would you recommend your course content delivery mechanism? 

Our Birds of a feather sessions will be captained by folks who have expertise delivering course content in different settings, to different audiences, and using different technologies. They are:

- [Cathy Newman](https://www.catherinenewman.org/) - University of Louisiana Monroe, Biology Program
- [Jamie Oaks](http://phyletica.org/) - Auburn University, Department of Biological Sciences and Museum of Natural History
- [Brian O'Meara](https://www.brianomeara.info/) - University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
- [Rachel Schwartz](https://schwartzlaburi.github.io/) - University of Rhode Island, Biological Sciences
- [April Wright](http://paleantology.com/) - Southeastern Louisiana University, Department of Biological Sciences

4:15-5: Share results of BoF with the large group. Discuss as a large group what major challenges still remain for teaching computation to evolutionary biologists.
