## Software Bazaar

We are pleased to present the following software projects at the iEvoBio Software Bazaar on Sunday, 
June 23 from 6:30-8:30 pm (concurrent with the poster session, and in the same room). 
If you are presenting, there will be tables, power sources, and signs available. 
If you would like to submit an entry to the Bazaar, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/iEvoBio2019/2019-iEvoBio/issues/new).


The Software Bazaar is a chance for software developers to bring their work directly to researchers. Space will be set up with power strips and tables, so that you can do demonstrations of your software's capabilities. If you're interested in participating, the [issue template](https://github.com/iEvoBio2019/2019-iEvoBio/issues/new) contains a template with all the information we need to get you registered. There is no cost of participate.
